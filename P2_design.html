    <h2> Purpose and Goals </h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of the website is to serve as a informationhub for Realfagskjelleren.
				The website should be able to answer the majority of questions curious visitors may have regarding
				opening hours, upcoming events and posibilities for work. To reach this goal the website requires
				a way to display past and future events and an about site with contact information. Another goal
				is to increase interest in Realfagskjelleren's events through the website. In that regard, the website
				requires a way to show media.

    <h2> Audience </h2>
    <p>
        The targeted audience is students, mainly those who belong to one of the four student
    unions running Realfagskjelleren. Most students have a need for human interaction, and
		Realfagskjelleren serves as a social gathering place where everyone is welcome.

    <h2> Final Location of the other Website </h2>

 	<p> Our initial plan is to use Github to host the site, as each person is
    allowed to host one simple website. There is currently no further plan for a future location</p>

	<h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>

	<p>We would like to have a calendar of which events Realfagskjelleren will be
	hosting. These are added on google calendar, however this is also used to
	schedule meetings and etc. Thus, one challenge will be to extract the correct
	events.

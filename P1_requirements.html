    <h2> Purpose and Goals </h2>
    <p>

        The purpose of the website is to give students a better insight into
        Realfagskjelleren. If you are wondering about the opening hours, which
        upcoming events there are, or applying for a working position to work
        there.

    <h2> Audience </h2>
    <p>
        The targeted audience is students who belong to one of the four student
    unions running Realfagskjelleren. Thus, the website is targeted at students
        from Volvox \& Alkymisten (Chemists and Biologists), Online (Computer
    Scientists), Spanskrøret (Teachers) and Delta (Mathematicians and
    Physisists).

    <h2>  Content of the Website and Organization </h2>

    <h3>"About"</h3>
     
    <p>
        This section will provide a brief biography about Nan Nan and the work that she does.
	      This pagewill help us achieve the goal of informing and intriguing users about Nan Nanâ€™s
	      life. This page will provide art teachers, students, and potential donors and volunteers
	      with their first impression of Nan Nan; thus, we plan to keep this page compelling yet
    </p>

    <h2> Specific Preferences </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Nan Nan would like the website to have a simple, clean look, possibly white
     with a texture. She would like such a background, because too complex of a
      background could potentially detract from the power of the artwork itself.
       She also believes that such a look would be more professional and reflect
       the concept of this website as an artistâ€™s website, more than just an art
       school website which may have a more playful look to it. </li>

	 <li> Nan Nan would like to have her artwork displayed in sections. </li>
	 <li> Nan Nan and Geir Henbest have specifically told us that they would like to
be able to modify the content of the website. Thus, we plan to use Javascript to
write the content.  </li>
	 <li> The content of the website should emphasize the paintings and sculpture. </li>
	 <li> If possible, our client would like to include some content in the local language,
 although this is not a requirement.  </li>

 </ul>

    <h2> Final Location of the Website </h2>

 	<p> Our initial plan is to use Github to host the site, as each person is
    allowed to host one simple website. </p>
    </section>

	<section>

	<h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>

	<p>We would like to have a calendar of which events Realfagskjelleren will be
	hosting. These are added on google calendar, however this is also used to
	schedule meetings and etc. Thus, one challenge will be to extract the correct
	events.

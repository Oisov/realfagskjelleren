      <h2>Purpose, Goals and Audience</h2>

      <p>The purpose of the website is to serve as a informationhub for
      Realfagskjelleren. Its main goal is to accessibly provide answers to
      questions students might have about Realfagskjelleren, and secondly also
      promote Realfagskjelleren and its interests. The targeted audience of this
      is mainly students</p>

      <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>

      <!-- TODO: figureringsnummer på bilder? -->
      <p> We choose a clique based structure for the navigation of
      Realfagskjellerens website, as seen in figure 1. Every page is reachable
      from the homepage through a menu on top. We thought this structure would
      minimize the time the user has to spend navigating from one page to the
      next.</p>

      <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3><li>General page layout</li></h3>
        <!-- TODO: størrelser -->
        <p>All our different html pages will be built in a similar fashion. On
        the right and left side there will be margins each taking 20% of the
        webpage width. At the top, and centered within the margins, we will have
        a custom made banner for Realfagskjelleren. Directly beneath the banner
        we have a navbar, also centered within the margins. The remaining place
        on the page is where the specific content for each site will be. The
        following mockup image illustrates the general layout</p>

        <!-- TODO: fargevalg -->
        <h3><li>Navbar</li></h3>

        <p>The navigation bar, or navbar, will be used for all our different html pages and will stay the same for  To be mobile friendly we decided to use semi-large buttons for the
        navbar.
          . </p>

        <h3><li>Fonts</li></h3> <p> We decided to go for Georgia as our main
        font, while our figures and paragraphs use Computer Modern. For both
        fonts we use Sans-sarif as our background. </p>

        <h3><li>Color Scheme</li></h3>

        <p>The official color scheme for Realfagskjellern is orange TODO: links,
        shadows, borders</p>



        <h3><li>Links</li></h3>

        <p>A short page with contact information of a select few individuals</p>

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <p> Our initial plan is to use Github to host the site, as each person is
      allowed to host one simple website. There is currently no further plan for
      a future location</p>

      <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

      <p>We would like to have a calendar of which events Realfagskjelleren will
      be hosting. These are added on google calendar, however this is also used
      to schedule meetings and etc. Thus, one challenge will be to extract the
      correct events. </p>

            <b>Google Forms:</b>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/AF9ZowFJoioJkoDq1"> Evaluation of
                  Realfagskjellerens website</a><br><br>

            <p>
                We based our query several other google forms from previous students and added our own touch. The google form is split into three parts. The first part is to obtain general information about the user, age, browser and operating system.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                The second part of the form asks the user to perform some simple tasks using the site. These tasks are meant to mimic real life tasks user might use the site for. Like figuring out how to get to Realfagskjelleren, what is the next event, and so forth.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The last part is a summary of how the user experience was using the site. How easy the navigation was, thoughts on the layout, apperance. Lastly the user was given the option to write their own opinions on what they liked about the page, what they disliked and if they had any ideas on additions to the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the live testing the user was asked to both navigate the site using mobile and a computer if possible. As we had spent a fair bit of time making sure our site was mobile-friendly.
            </p>

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>

            <p>
                We wanted both feedback from users well aquainted with Realfagskjelleren and new users. In order to obtain feedback from experiences users we posted the google form query on Realfagskjellerens facebook page.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The live testing was done with users oblivious to Realfagskjelleren. To create a comfortable environment for the user the testing was done with only the user and tester present. We also made sure to inform the user that it was how well the site performed and not the user that was being tested. In addition the test was performed in a calm enviroment to avoid stress for the user. We measured how many missclicks the user performed, and how easilly they were able to answer the questions in the google form.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The users that livetested was choosen in the age range 18-24 and students to create a representative selection.

            <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>

            <p>Interestingly enough nearly all of our users used the Chrome/Chromium browser. This made it difficult to discover the bugs related to other browsers. We will come back to this later</p>

            <p>In contrast to browsers the varity in operating systems were much broader. Interestingly enough while some users use iOS and OSX they still opt to use Google Chrome as their browsers and not the more common option Safari.</p>

            <h2>Feedback summary</h2>


            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>

            <p>
            We wanted to see how easy this information could be obtained from
            our site. the premise for this scenario is that the user imagines
            being a new student looking for information about Realfagskjelleren.
            The questions also tells a story where the imagined student ends up
            going to the next event Realfagskjelleren is hosting. This sets the
            setting nicely for the next scenario. 
            <p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>What is Realfagskjelleren?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            All answers given in the Google form were correct to this question.
            Some users noted that it was not clear enough from the text on the
            <i>"About us"</i> page that all students were welcome, not just
            those studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).
            </p><br>


            <ul>
                <li>Realfagskjelleren is run by 4 different student unions, which?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The answer to this question was written at the start of the
                    second paragraph on the <i>"About us"</i> page. Here we had
                two joksters writing something completely wrong. Ignoring those
                two everyone was able to quickly answer this question correctly.
                The livetests had no missclicks but complained about the
                slightly small text. 
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Which event is the next Realfagskjelleren is hosting?</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                It must be noted that throughout the survey the answer to this
                question changed, as our home page fetches data from
                Realfagskjellerens facebook page.

                Taking this into consideration about 81% of the users answered
            this question correct. One live tester expressed some confusion as
            there were no future events, however he was quickly able to deduce
            this from the text on the frontpage and the empty  <i>"Future
            Events"</i> list on the <i>"Events"</i> page. 
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>How easy was it to use the page to naviagate through the
                    questions above?</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
            none of the live testers expressed any difficuly in answering these
            questions, and the google form mostly confirms this. most users 62% found the
            questions very easy to answer. about 25% found them easy to answer,
            while only 6.3% found them difficult.
            </p><br>

            </figure>


            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>

            <p>
                In this scenario we wanted to illustrate uses more seasoned students
                might have for the site and to motivate the users we added an humorstic
                touch. The premise for this scenario is that the user attended
                Realfagskjellerens previous event, but by mysterious forces can not
                seem to remember much, and has lost several important possesions.
            </p><br>


            <ul>
                <li>You attended Realfagskjellerens last event. What is the name
                of the event you attended?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>About 40% of the users was able correctly answer this question
            correctly. This accounts for both spelling mistakes and that the
                previous event changes as Realfagskjelleren hosts events.

            <figure>
                <img src="./img/nextEvent.png" alt="figure 2: Representation of the
                      browsers used">
                <figcaption>
                    Figure 2: The representation of browsers used
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>How many other guests attended the same event?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The purpose of this question were to test whether the users realised
                that the event images were links to the facebook event.
                This questions was the most difficult to answer nd only about 14%
                of the users were able to find the correct number of attendees.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Several users where quickly able to quickly able to navigate to
            the relevant event. After some searching on the page all of them
            tried to click on the image, taking them to the event on facebook.
            However due to a strange pagedesign the testers struggled finding
            the information on facebook. At most this took 4 minutes and 5
            misslicks to find the correct number. 
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>You barely remember jello shots? Are there any image
                evidence for this on the website?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this question we wanted the users to navigate to the page with
            images and see whether the image in question was present. However to
            our default the question was worded poorly. There are no images of
            jello shots on the website, however there is an image of jello shots
                being made.

            This lead to about 50% of the users answering yes, while the other
            half answered no. The live testers spent quite some time combing the
            images for signs of jello, but was quickly able to navigate to the
                site with the images. time

            In addition every person we saw live was able to figure out that
            clicking on the images zooms.</p><br>


            <ul>
                <li>You did not just lose your dignity yesterday, but also your
                vallet and want it back. What is Realfagskjellerens email? </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In order to answer this question the user had to click an image
                of a letter on the bottom in the footer of the page. This letter was only
                immediately visible on the pages with no scroll, as the footer
                sticks to the bottom.

                About 57% of the users were able to answer this question.
                Several live testers attempted to find the information in the
                <i>"about us"</i> page, but after some time they were able to
                correctly find the adress. At most this took 2 minutes and 3
                missclicks. 

            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>To make yourself feel better you decide to post the
                embaressing photos you found of your mate. Which # does
                Realfagskjellerens use on instragram?</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                Similarly to the question above this one could be answered by
                clicking the instagram icon in the footer. About 70% of the
                users were able to answer this question. humorously one user
                finally admitted in their answer that they had yet to visit
                Realfagskjellerens page.
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>How easy was it to use the page to naviagate through the
                questions above?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We see that these questions were harder to answer than the
            previous ones. About 37% still thought the questions were easy,
                while 12% found them hard and 18% found them neither hard nor easy.

            One user in particular noted that finding the number of attendees
            from facebook were challenging.</p><br>

            <h3>General Feedback</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>How tempted are you in visiting Realfagskjelleren after
                using the page?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>About 80% said that they wanted to visit Realfagskjelleren after
            using the page. About 6% said that they had gained some interest,
                while 12% said that they were ambvivalent. </p><br>
            <p>The users who said their interest in Realfagskjelleren had not
                increased where asked why. Here the response where very varying.
                About 12% said that they obtained the
            same information from facebook, 15% did not attending events where
                alcohol were present, while 10% complained about the menu.

            When asked after the survey what the problem with the menu was the
                live tester explained about the small fontsize on his mobile</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>What do you think about the appereance of the site?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One user complimented us on the beautiful symmetry of the
            website. About 30% really loved the design, and said: "It feels just
            like being in Realfagskjelleren". Approximately 18% though the page
            looked fine, while 18% said it mediocre. The remaining users did not
            have any strong opinions either for or against the design.</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Was there something in particular that caught your eye, and
                you liked about the site?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At the end of the survey we gave the users three questions they
            could answer freely. Several users complimented us on the games. One
            user liked the color combination (what?). It was also remarked that
            navigating the page was surprisingly easy, and everything was very
                organized.
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Was there anything with the page that did not work or could
                be improved?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The users of Realfagskjelleren seems really into games, as again
            several users wanted more games. Some others complained that one
            could not order alcoholic beverages on the website. More seriously we recieved
                complaints about the following both in the form and from the livetesters: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The color choices for the active page and timer</li>
                <li>Image placement on the About us page</li>
                <li>The site does not work</li>
                <li>There is no space between the text and the borders of the page</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>If you could add one additional feauture to the site, what
                would you add?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Again we recieved some quite humourusly responses. One user
            wanted to have a button to send a Taxi to Realfagskjelleren, while
            another wanted home delivery of beverages from Realfagskjelleren.
            More seriously we noted the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Multiplayer version of "Finn toeren", more functionality in
                the "dice" game.</li>
                <li>More games, they wanted something called "Realfags ruletten"?</li>
                <li>Number to Norwegian Poison Information Centre and National
                drug helpline in Norway</li>
                <li>More student songs</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Response</h2>

            <p>
                Deciding which responses to take seriously and which to ignore posed some
                difficulty. However with the help of live testers we where able to
                narrow down which changes where the most dire to improve.
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>The page does not work</li>

                <p>
                    As shown in the form nearly all of our users use Chrome, while the
                    remaining handfull uses Firefox. This actually became a problem as we discovered
                    our script for fetching events did not work in Internet Explorer, but
                    more importantly Safari. Thus, it is our opinion that the most dire thing
                    to fix is to make the website fully functional in Safari. We had spent
                    about 1-2 days combing our Javascript files to find the error, alas we
                    ran out of time for bug hinting and had to instead focus on finishing
                    the reports. While it unnacceptable that the events and timer
                    functionality does not work in Safari, it is not completely a disaster
                    as mentioned previously nearly all users use a browser our site
                    supports.

                <li>Image placement on the About us page</li>

                <p>
                Previously we had two images on the "About us" page. This was
                changed about half way throught the survey, to just one image
                and text side by side. This coincidentally also fixes the
                problem with the text running into the margin.
                </p><br>

                <li>The color choices for the active page and timer</li>

                <p>
                The colors for realfagskjelleren are by default black and
                orange, and this makes adding a third color surprisingly
                difficult. We did try to add the complimentary color of orange -
                in other words blue - to our site. However, that looked even
                worse. Thus, we temporarly settled on green as it is a very
                natural color for something that is active. We totally forgot to
                change these colors before sending out the forms.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                One solution to this problem could be to add some shades of gray
                to the active menu, while changing the colors for the timer
                seems more difficult. One solution might be to talk with some of
                our friends on NTNU who studies some form of design and help us
                find good complimentary secondary colors.
                </p><br>

                <li>There is no space between the text and the borders of the
                    page. The textsize is very small.</li>

                <p>Again we have no excuse for this. Adding padding and margins
                    for paragraphs and headliners is very simple. We have just
                    been lazy and had our focus elsewhere. </p><br>

                <p>Our group did have a short discussion about textsize though.
            We were unsure if we should scale the text, or if this was something
            that should be left ot the user. As our banners, footers are fixed
            increasing the fontsize does not affect the page design.</p><br>
            </ul>


            <p>
        As a whole the users found the site to be very easy to navigate. While
        most users had difficulty finding the number of attendees this is mostly
        facebooks fault not ours. We talked with Andreas (the leader of
        Realfagskjelleren) and while we could have fetched the number of
        attendees and displayed that number on the webpage, this was not
        desirable. In addition that question was made in order to check whether
        the users were able to deduce that the event images were hyperlinks.

              <b>Google Forms:</b>
              <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/AF9ZowFJoioJkoDq1"> Evaluation of
                  Realfagskjellerens website</a><br><br>

              <p>
              We based our query several other google forms from previous
              students and added our own touch. The google form is split into
              three parts. The first part is to obtain general information about
                  the user, age, browser and operating system.
             </p><br>

              <p>
                  The second part of the form asks the user to perform some
              simple tasks using the site. These tasks are meant to mimic real
              life tasks user might use the site for. Like figuring out how to get to
                  Realfagskjelleren, what is the next event, and so forth.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                  The last part is a summary of how the user experience was
                  using the site. How easy the navigation was, thoughts on the
                  layout, apperance. Lastly the user was given the option to write
                  their own opinions on what they liked about the page, what they
                  disliked and if they had any ideas on additions to the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In the live testing the user was asked to both navigate the
                  site using mobile and a computer if possible. As we had spent
                  a fair bit of time making sure our site was mobile-friendly. 
              </p>

          <h2>Tester Audience</h2>

              <p>
                  We wanted both feedback from users well aquainted with
                  Realfagskjelleren and new users. In order to obtain feedback from
                  experiences users we posted the google form query on Realfagskjellerens
                  facebook page.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                  The live testing was done with users oblivious to
                  Realfagskjelleren. To create a comfortable environment for the
                  user the testing was done with only the user
                  and tester present. We also made sure to inform the user that it was how well
                  the site performed and not the user that was being tested. In
                  addition the test was performed in a calm enviroment to avoid
                  stress for the user. We measured how many missclicks the user
                  performed, and how easilly they were able to answer the questions
                  in the google form. 
              </p><br>
              <p>
                  The users that livetested was choosen in the age range 18-24 and
                  students to create a representative selection.

          <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>

          <p>Interestingly enough nearly all of our users used the
          Chrome/Chromium browser. This made it difficult to discover the bugs
          related to other browsers. We will come back to this latex</p>

                      browsers used">

            Figure 2: The representation of browsers used
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

          <p>In contrast to browsers the varity in operating systems were much
          broader. Interestingly enough while some users use iOS and OSX they
          still opt to use Google Chrome as their browsers and not the more
          common option Safari.</p>
